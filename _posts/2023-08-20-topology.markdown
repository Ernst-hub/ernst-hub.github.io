# Topology

Point set topology / general topology is the study of the general abstract nature of continuity or "closeness" on [spaces](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Space.html). Basic point-set topological notions are ones like [continuity](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/ContinuousSpace.html), [dimension](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Dimension.html), [compactness](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/CompactSpace.html), and [connectedness](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/ConnectedSpace.html).

If we have a set of points \\(X\\), \\(J_X\\) is a topology of \\(X\\) that contains a lot of subsets of \\(X\\).

These subsets inside the topology are called open sets \\(u\\). 

\\(\\)
u_1, u_2, u_3 \in J_X
\\(\\)

Rules:

\\(\\)
\begin{align}\cup u_i \in J_X \end{align}
\\(\\)

\\(\\)
\begin{align} \cap u_i \in J_x \end{align}
\\(\\)

The intersections have to be a finite number of open sets.

The null set is also in the topology of X and the set itself is an element in the topology of X. These mark the smallest and largest elements of X.

\\(\\)
\emptyset \in J_X, \quad X \in J_X
\\(\\)

## What is an open set?

We use the notion “[open balls](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/OpenBall.html)” to constitute open sets. 

It is understood by reference to a euclidean n-space. For example, if we are in a two-dimensional euclidian space, the open ball is seen as a disc. On the contrary, if we are in 3D, the open ball is seen as a sphere. Note however, the “surface” of the ball is not contained by the set that constitutes the open ball.

The open balls become the `base` of the topology, because we can union an infinite amount sets constructed by open balls to make up the topology \\(J_X\\). 

We could also use open rectangles or another shape for that matter, but the common practice is open balls.

There exists different types of topologies:

1. The usual topology is the topology constructed by some combination of open balls.
2. The discrete: which amounts to the power set \\(2^X\\), i.e. it contains all possible sets of \\(X\\).
3. `The trivial topology` which amounts to \\(J_X = \{ \emptyset, X\}\\), simply contains \\(X\\) itself and the empty set.

## What is a closed set?

A closed set is simply the complement of an open set.

\\(X \setminus u\\)

The rules following a closed set is the almost the same as (1) and (2), except now we can intersect over an infinite number of closed sets and unionise a finite number of closed sets.

## The notion of limit points

### Open neighbourhood

An open neighbourhood of a point P is an open set that contains the point P

Therefore, open sets are open neighbourhoods of all of its points.

### Limit points

Let \\(P\\) be a limit point of \\(S\\), where \\(S \subset X\\), IF every neighbourhood of P (\\(u_{P}\\)) contain some element of \\(S\\).

Thus the following must be true:

\\(\\)
u_P\cap S \neq \emptyset
\\(\\)

The following is NOT always true:

\\(\\)
u_P \cap S = u_p \ ,
\\(\\)

because, \\(u_P\\) can exist on the border of \\(S\\), which still constitutes a limit point

The same is true for a single missing point inside of \\(S\\).  

## Closure

The closure of the set is the set unionised with all of its limit points. 

- If you have an open ball, the closure of that ball is the open ball plus its boundary

## Interior

A point \\(P\\) is in the interior of \\(S\\) if I can find an open set of \\(P\\) \\(u_P\\) that is a subset of \\(S\\).


\\(\\)
u_P \cap S = u_p \  \rightarrow p\in S^{o}
\\(\\)

**Important:** The interior of any set is always open!

The union of every open set contained in S is the interior of S. 

If S is an open set, \\(S = S^{o}\\)

The interior is the complement of the closure of the complement of \\(S\\).

## Exterior

The exterior of a set \\(S\\) is the complement of its closure.

## The Boundary

What is not in the exterior nor in the interior.

## Density

\\(S\\) is dense in \\(X\\), if every point in \\(X\\) (\\(P \in X\\))  is either also a point in \\(S\\) or a limit point of \\(S\\). Hence we can simplify it to say that \\(P \in \bar{S}\\) where \\(\bar{S}\\) is the closure of \\(S\\)
