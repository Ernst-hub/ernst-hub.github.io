## On world models

I want to spend a few minutes commenting on the notion of "world models", as they have been commonly used descriptors of large language models (LLMs). LLMs are referred to as world models due to the fact that they are incredibly good at storing textual information. As they are trained on vast amounts of human-written text, essentially they are a representation of the world we live in.

Firstly, let us understand what modelling really is about and later on reflect more on this connection. Afterward, I intend to let my thoughts wander unstructured and see if I get somewhere interesting.
